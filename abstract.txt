Fetching execution metrics from data sources is a common task in many applications that rely on data-driven decision making. However, different data sources may have different formats, schemas, and quality levels, which make it challenging to compare and aggregate metrics across them. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to translate execution metrics from heterogeneous data sources into a unified metrics space using autoencoders. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network that can learn efficient codings of unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner. We use autoencoders to encode the execution metrics from each data source into a lower-dimensional latent representation, and then decode them back into a common metrics format. This way, we can reduce the dimensionality and noise of the original metrics, and also capture the most important features and relationships among them. We evaluate our approach on several real-world data sources and show that it can produce accurate and consistent unified metrics that can be used for further analysis and visualization.
Spark is a popular framework for large-scale data processing that allows users to run various applications on distributed clusters. However, optimizing the performance of Spark jobs is not trivial, as it depends on many factors such as the execution time, the number of virtual cores, and the number of containers allocated for each job. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict these parameters using quantum neural networks (QNNs). QNNs are machine learning models that combine artificial neural networks and quantum information to develop more efficient algorithms. We use QNNs to leverage the quantum effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference to enhance the learning capacity and generalization ability of the models. We train our QNNs using the unified metrics obtained from different data sources using autoencoders, which are a type of neural network that can learn efficient codings of unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate our approach on several real-world Spark datasets and show that it can achieve better accuracy and scalability than classical neural networks.
